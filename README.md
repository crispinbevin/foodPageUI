This is a project that I undertook at FERNS IT Solutions to understand the working of a food delivery page.

## How to Run after cloning this repository
```bash
cd foodpage
npm install       # Install dependencies (only needed once)
npm run dev       # Start the development server
```

I was provided with their API documentation and asked to build a barebones system that lets a user create account, login, and view food products.

I did this using REACT and Tailwind CSS library for styling.

Login page UI. the graphics went on the left side hence the space.

List of all the food items available derived through an API call and arranged using CSS grid system and implementing a skeleton loading system.
